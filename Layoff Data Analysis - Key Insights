Project Overview

This project analyzes layoffs across various companies using SQL. The dataset contains records of layoffs categorized by company, year, and total employees laid off. The goal of this analysis is to identify trends in layoffs, understand industry impacts, and gain insights into workforce reductions over time.

Key Insights

1. Companies with the Highest Layoffs

The top companies with the most layoffs include:

Uber

Booking.com

Airbnb

Cisco

Amazon

These companies had significant layoffs, possibly due to financial restructuring, market downturns, or global crises like the COVID-19 pandemic.

2. Year-wise Layoff Trends

Layoffs peaked in certain years, particularly during major economic events.

If layoffs increased significantly in a particular year, external factors such as recession, industry slowdowns, or global crises may have contributed.

3. Industry Impact

If industry data is available, the most affected sectors are likely Tech, Travel, and Retail, which experienced mass layoffs.

Companies in these industries often had to downsize due to revenue losses and shifting consumer behavior.

4. Data Quality and Missing Values

344 records have missing total_laid_off values.

Future improvements could involve filling in missing values using external reports or estimating them based on similar companies.

5. Potential Further Analysis

Comparison with market trends: Analyzing how layoffs correlate with stock market trends or financial reports.

Visualization of layoffs: Creating bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts in Power BI, Tableau, or Python to better illustrate trends.

Predictive Modeling: If historical data is available, machine learning could predict future layoffs based on economic indicators.

Next Steps

Improve data quality by addressing missing values.

Add industry segmentation to see which industries are most affected.

Create visualizations to better communicate key insights.

Expand the dataset by including additional features like revenue, profit, and stock performance for deeper analysis.

This analysis provides an overview of layoffs using SQL. Further improvements can be made by integrating additional data sources and visualizing the findings in a more interactive manner.
